## Tensor Hub

Tensor Hub is a versatile AI-powered web application that allows users to analyze data using various machine learning models powered by TensorFlow.js. The current version supports image analysis using the MobileNet model, but the app is designed to incorporate additional models in the future. Tensor Hub provides predictions with confidence scores and allows users to download the analysis results. It’s built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a fast, responsive front-end experience.

Features

	•	Upload a file (e.g., images) for analysis
	•	Analyze data using the MobileNet model
	•	View detailed predictions with confidence percentages
	•	Download the analysis results as a text file
	•	Responsive design with full mobile and tablet support
	•	Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for performance and scalability
	•	Planned future support for all TensorFlow.js models (e.g., text, object detection)
